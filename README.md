# Text Summarization Model using FLAN-T5-Base
This project features a text summarization model based on the FLAN-T5-Base architecture. The model is fine-tuned with the wikiSum dataset to generate concise and accurate summaries of text documents. The performance of the model is evaluated using the ROUGE metric, including ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and ROUGE-Lsum scores.

## Features
1. Advanced Model: Utilizes the FLAN-T5-Base model for state-of-the-art text summarization.  
2. Fine-Tuned Dataset: Trained with the wikiSum dataset to enhance summarization quality and relevance.  
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: Assessed using ROUGE metrics, including ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and ROUGE-Lsum, to ensure high-quality summaries.  
4. Customizable Parameters: Allows for adjustments and fine-tuning to cater to specific summarization needs.  

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Prepare your dataset and configure the system. 
3. Train the model with the wikiSum dataset.  
4. Evaluate the model using ROUGE metrics.  
5. Generate text summaries for your documents.
